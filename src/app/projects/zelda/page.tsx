      In my bachelor project at the <a className="text-purple-500 hover:underline" href="https://www.itu.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT University of Copenhagen</a>, I delved into the realm of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) in the context of Mixed-Initiative Content Creation (MI-CC). The aim was to automate game level design for <span className="italic text-white">The Legend of Zelda</span>.<br /><br /> 
      We developed a system that allows users to fix specific tiles, while the rest of the level grows through an evolved <span className="italic text-white">Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)</span> model. The users also have the freedom to select a model from a trained archive of NCA models. This results in a diverse array of specialized level generators capable of creating playable game levels. The generators consider both the specific level characteristics and the user-defined fixed tiles. <br /> <br />
      Our experiments revealed that models trained on specific fixed tiles considerably outperform a baseline model that was trained without user input. Nonetheless, training models to manage a variety of fixed tile types still poses a challenge, hence indicating room for improvement in our proposed model training strategies. <br /> <br />
      This project taught me a lot about evolutionary algorithms, namely <span className="text-white italic">Quality Diversity Optimization</span>. Which was a nice way to conduct my studies as that is something my bachelor did not cover in much detail. The project's code is available on <a className="text-purple-500 hover:underline" href="https://github.com/interactive-nca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and you can even try our proposed system at the project's website <a className="text-purple-500 hover:underline" href="https://zeldalevelcraft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. I am hopeful that this work can be a useful resource for researchers exploring INCAs and serve as a solid foundation for future research employing NCAs for MI-CC.
